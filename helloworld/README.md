# Overview
This is my first GitHub upload. I wanted to create a place where employers, and fellow programmers can see my knowlede and skills.

I simply have a python file that outputs "Hello World". This hello world folder has been all about creating an environment an a GitHub Repository, not about the actual code.

# Development Environment

I used VS Code to write my hello world and create a GitGub Repository.

It wsa created in Python, a language I am new to.
