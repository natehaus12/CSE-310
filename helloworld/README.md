# Overview
This is my first GitHub upload. I wanted to create a place where employers, and fellow programmers can see my knowlede and skills.

I simply have a python file that outputs "Hello World". This hello world file has been all about creating an environment an a GitHub Repository, not about the actual code.


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I used VS Code to write my hello world and create a GitGub Repository.

It wsa created in Python, a language I am new to.
